Dr. Vakil is known to me since many years. I was always of a very high opinion about his medicinal and pharmacological knowledge about drugs and human body system. I have recently had an opportunity to seek his expertise as a homeo doctor as well and have found his diagnosis and prescription working so well in finding the root cause of the issue and it’s speedy termination. He is professional but on top of that he has an extreme humane behaviour that he demonstrates in understanding his patients’ problems and helping them out.

A few weeks ago, on one of my friends recommendation,  I approached Dr. Shah and discussed an old recurring medical condition.
I kept on using his prescribed medicines for three weeks  but it seemed that my situation had been in a fix and was not changing at all. Obviously I was a bit disappointed but I knew it somewhere deep in my heart that my patience would make it worth my while. A few days ago, suddenly I felt a very significant change in my condition and it has been improving on a daily basis. I am really thankful to Dr. Shah for his dedication and persistence.  Surely patience is divine!

I contacted Dr. Shah for a chronic case after reviewing the google reviews and I just got what I was expecting: attention to my unique case and clear communication. I feel very comfortable consulting Dr. Shah. He pays attention to my concerns and I really appreciate the open and honest feedback and instructions. He is very professional, prompt, and tries to help the patient in a genuine manner.

Homeopathy is a long term solution. It’s been a few months since I started the medication and I already  feel more energetic in general. I am positive that I will see even better results as time progresses. Thank you Dr. Shah, appreciate the great work and support you provide to us.

Dr Shah is a knowledgeable, experienced, and passionate homeopathic consultant. He helped me with my chronic issue and removed my long time dependency on antibiotics. He takes time to understand the holistic view of the person and then prepares a targeted therapy (medicine) to address the root cause. I have found him very approachable and kind. My comments are based on my experience of consulting with him on different occasions for myself and my family since 2013.

I found Dr. Shah is one of the best doctors I've ever had. He is very professional, kind, experienced, brilliant, and really cares about his patients. He took the time to listen to my health issues, assessed and provided me with his advice and medicine. He made me feel comfortable, not rushed and answered all of my questions and concerns. I would definitely recommend him.

We have been going to Dr. Vakil for 5 plus years now. He is very detail oriented and take times to go through your history. He gives you enough time and prepares medication as per your symptoms. My husband felt a significant difference in his allergy conditions after doing a medicine course with him. For my children too, I go to him. Highly recommend him.
